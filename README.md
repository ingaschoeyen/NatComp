# Code of Group 13 for SOW-IMC042 Natural Computing (24/25)

Our group consists of:
* Roman Dvorak (s1157838)
* Kelly Karremans (s4802802)
* Inga Sch√∂yen (s1127295)

## Assignment 1: Cell Migratory Behavior

The [code](/ass1) for this assignment contains the base code required to run the artistoo library by Wortel & Textor (2021).
For the assignment, we simulate the behavior of cells in an environment with obstacles.

## Assignment 2: Negative Selection

The [code](/ass2) for this assignment contains the base code required to run the negative selection algorithm, negsel2.jar.


## Assignment 3: Swarm Intelligence and Flocking Behavior

The [code](/ass3) for this assignment contains the base code required to run the [boids simulation](/ass3/exercise_boids/), as well as the [PSO](/ass3/exercise_pso/).


## Assignment 4: Evolutionary Algorithms
The [code](/ass4) for this assignment contains the base code required to run the [genetic algorithm](/ass4/a2/) and the [evolutionary strategy](/ass4/b1/). Lastly, an application of the evolutionary algorithm and the memetic algorithm to the travelling salesperson problem is [included](/ass4/b2/).
